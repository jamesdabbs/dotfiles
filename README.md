# Pre-Reset

Be sure to back up
* All files in the /data directory
* The 1password vault


# Pre-Setup

You will need (/ probably really want)

* iTerm
* brew (which may require developer tools)

Once you're ready, run `run`. It should be entirely self-contained and idempotent


# Post-Setup

You'll probably want to do some other manual things:

## Applications to install

* 1Password
  * Import vault from backup
* Chrome
  * Sign in for sync'd data, bookmarks

## Other config

* Set capslock to control
* Remove unused dock icons
* Set desktop background
* Enable tap-to-click
* Link iCal with google, work calendars
